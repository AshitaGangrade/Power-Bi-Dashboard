# Employee - Dashboard

## Problem Statement

By aggregating and visualizing key metrics, it enables HR and management teams to gain insights into employee headcount, performance, and training cost. Through data on employee performance indicators, the dashboard helps identify patterns and areas needing attention. It allows for a better understanding of employee status, areas of dissatisfaction, and factors contributing to productivity or inefficiency. By utilizing this dashboard, the organization can proactively address concerns, enhance employee experience, and optimize processes to foster a more productive and satisfied workforce.


Since,Low performance scores suggest a need for increased training. Targeted programs can enhance skills, address weaknesses, and boost productivity. Pre-assessment ensures focused training aligns with improvement goals. 

Also Due to the limited headcount in the Executive Office Department, recruiting additional employees is essential. Increasing the team size will help manage workload effectively, improve efficiency, and ensure smoother operations.
